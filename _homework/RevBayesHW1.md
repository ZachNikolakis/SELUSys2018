## RevBayes Homework One

1. In Fig. 2, what would each of these distributions say about the skill of the archer? 
The higher the alpha parameter the higher the skill of the archer. The distribution with the alpha parameter of 2 has a higher density distribution closer to the bullseye.
2. In Fig. 3, why is the number of observations constant?
The observations are constant because these are known shots from the archer. 
3. If you were not able to, finish the compilation of RevBayes. Copy the executeable (called rb) into your work directory.
